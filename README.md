Pneumonia diagnosis using AI is hindered by limited labeled X-ray datasets, making it difficult to train accurate models. The imbalance between normal and pneumonia cases further reduces model generalization. Additionally, strict privacy regulations restrict access to real patient data, limiting dataset availability. To overcome these challenges, GAN-generated synthetic X-ray images provide a privacy-compliant, diverse, and balanced dataset, improving AI-driven pneumonia detection.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) help overcome data limitations in medical imaging by generating high-quality synthetic images. They address data scarcity and imbalance, ensuring AI models generalize better across diverse patient populations. GANs protect patient privacy by creating realistic images without using real patient data. They also reduce annotation costs by minimizing the need for expert-labeled datasets. GANs improve model performance by providing pathology-specific synthetic images, making medical AI more accurate, ethical, and widely applicable.
